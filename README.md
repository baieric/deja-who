Deja Who
========
A new way to be social on Android.

Do you ever wonder if youâ€™d be friends with strangers you pass by if you only got the chance to know them? Deja Who is an app that lets you learn about the people around you. If you pass by someone for the second time, and you both tell the app you want to talk to each other, a chat for the two of you is created!

This Android app began as a hackathon project for Hack the North. It is still a work in progress.
