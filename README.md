Deja Who
========
A new way to be social on Android.

Do you ever wonder if youâ€™d be friends with strangers you pass by if you only got the chance to know them? Deja Who is an app that lets you learn about the people around you. If you find anyone interesting on the app, you can tell Deja Who you would like to talk to them. If you pass by them for the second time, and they also said they want to talk to you, a chat for the two of you is created!

This Android app began as a hackathon project for Hack the North. It is still a work in progress.
